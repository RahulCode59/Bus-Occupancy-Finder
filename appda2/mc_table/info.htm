<h2>Description</h2>
The goal of this script is to show how to build a table from MultiCells.<br>
As MultiCells go to the next line after being output, the base idea consists in saving the
current position, printing the MultiCell and resetting the position to its right.<br>
There is a difficulty, however, if the table is too long: page breaks. Before outputting a
row, it is necessary to know whether it will cause a break or not. If it does overflow, a
manual page break must be done first.<br>
To do so, the height of the row must be known in advance; it is the maximum of the heights of
the MultiCells it is made up of. To know the height of a MultiCell, the NbLines() method is used:
it returns the number of lines a MultiCell will occupy.
